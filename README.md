# Microservice Project using Spring Boot, Eureka, and Feign Client

Welcome to our Microservice Project README! This document provides an overview of our project and guides you through the setup, usage, and key considerations when working with microservices built using Spring Boot, Eureka for service discovery, and Feign Client for declarative REST client.

## Introduction

Our microservice project is built to demonstrate a scalable and resilient microservices architecture. We utilize Spring Boot to rapidly develop microservices, Eureka for service registration and discovery, and Feign Client for simplified RESTful service communication.

## Architecture Overview

Our architecture follows the principles of microservices, allowing each service to be independently deployable and scalable. Key components include:

- **Spring Boot**: Provides a robust framework for building Java-based microservices with minimal configuration.
- **Eureka**: A service registry and discovery server that enables microservices to find and communicate with each other without hardcoded service locations.
- **Feign Client**: A declarative REST client that simplifies the interaction with other microservices by enabling direct calls to their REST APIs.

## Setup

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the project repository from the Git repository hosting service.

2. **Build Microservices**: Use Maven or Gradle to build each microservice.

3. **Configure Eureka Server**: Set up the Eureka server as the central service registry and discovery server.

4. **Configure Microservices**: Update the configuration files of each microservice to register with the Eureka server and define service endpoints.

5. **Implement Feign Clients**: Create Feign clients within each microservice to declare interactions with other microservices using interfaces and annotations.

6. **Run Microservices**: Start instances of each microservice, ensuring they register with the Eureka server.

7. **Test Service Communication**: Test the communication between microservices by invoking methods defined in Feign clients.

## Usage

Once the setup is complete, you can interact with the microservices using HTTP requests or by invoking methods defined in Feign clients. Here are some usage guidelines:

1. **Service Discovery**: Utilize Eureka's dashboard to monitor registered microservices and their health status.

2. **Feign Clients**: Use Feign clients to invoke RESTful APIs of other microservices as if they were local method calls, simplifying inter-service communication.

3. **Load Balancing**: Eureka provides built-in client-side load balancing, allowing microservices to distribute incoming requests among multiple instances.

4. **Fault Tolerance**: Implement circuit breakers and fallback mechanisms to handle failures and prevent cascading failures within the system.
